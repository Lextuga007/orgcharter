# orgcharter

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of orgcharter is to help make simple organisation charts, to
help you communicate your organisationâ€™s structure to those who need to
understand it.  
Often, that is the people who work within it!

This package is a convenient wrapper around the
[{DiagrammeR}](https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR) package. If
you are interested in understanding more or extending this package, that
is a very good place to start.

## Installation

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ThomUK/orgcharter")
```
